    description: "The original Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) pioneered accessible plug-in hybrid technology in the SUV segment, based on the second/third-generation Outlander platform. The innovative powertrain combined a 2.0L gasoline engine with two electric motors—one at each axle—creating a unique all-wheel drive system without needing a traditional driveshaft. A 12 kWh lithium-ion battery provided an electric-only range of approximately 30-35 miles (depending on testing standard and model year). Total system output was approximately 200 horsepower, with the ability to operate in three distinct modes: EV Mode (using only electric power), Series Hybrid Mode (where the engine generates electricity for the motors), and Parallel Hybrid Mode (where both the engine and motors power the vehicle). Unlike many competing hybrids, the Outlander PHEV offered DC fast-charging capability, allowing an 80% battery charge in approximately 25 minutes. The system also featured unique capabilities including Vehicle-to-Home power supply functionality in some markets. Visually distinguished from conventional Outlander models by subtle PHEV badging, unique wheels, and additional charging port. The interior largely matched standard Outlanders but with hybrid-specific displays and controls. A significant update in 2016 brought refined styling, improved electric motors, and a more efficient gasoline engine, while a 2018 revision increased battery capacity to 13.8 kWh and engine displacement to 2.4L, improving both performance and efficiency. The Outlander PHEV became the world's best-selling plug-in hybrid SUV, finding particular success in European markets where incentives favored its combination of electric capability and practical utility."

    description: "The second-generation Outlander PHEV is based on the fourth-generation Outlander platform, featuring the same bold exterior styling but with PHEV-specific details including unique badging, distinct wheel designs, and additional charging port. The plug-in hybrid system received a comprehensive upgrade, now combining a larger 2.4L gasoline engine with more powerful electric motors—85 kW at the front and 100 kW at the rear—and a significantly larger 20 kWh battery pack. This system delivers approximately 38-54 miles of electric-only range (depending on testing standard) and a combined 248 horsepower. The seven-mode drive selector adds additional options beyond the previous generation, including Power, Eco, and Normal settings that adjust system response and efficiency. An innovative one-pedal driving mode allows vehicle control primarily through the accelerator pedal. The new platform enables a full seven-seat configuration, making it one of the few plug-in hybrids to offer three-row seating. DC fast-charging capability continues, now providing up to 80% charge in approximately 38 minutes. The interior matches the significant improvements of the standard fourth-generation Outlander with high-quality materials, a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with PHEV-specific displays, and available head-up display. Advanced safety features include MI-PILOT Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance. The second-generation Outlander PHEV builds on the success of its predecessor with substantially improved electric capability, performance, and refinement, positioning it as one of the most versatile plug-in hybrid SUVs on the market, combining significant electric-only range with practical utility and genuine all-weather capability through its dual-motor all-wheel drive system."
